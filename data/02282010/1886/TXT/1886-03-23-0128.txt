tocnl Taxation (Incidence),-Motion madé, and Question proposed, 'That the present" system under
which,, in England and Wales, the first Incidence of Local Taxation ( with some slight exceptions )
falls on the occupier and not on the owner of lands and tenements is unjust; tliat such owners
ought in equity to iieaf at least a moiety of those charges; that the system under which country
mansions are rated is unfair; and that the owners of ground rents in towns are liable to no part,
of those chargés, the outlay of which is-essential in order that the property may possess nny-
markelable value whatever:"-(Mr. Thorold Rogers .·)-
Amendment proposed, to leave out from the word "That" to tlu1 end of the· Question,
in order to add the words." while the apportionment of the payment «if Rates between
landlord and tenant may be desirable, as (»art of a complete scheine· for remedying the
admitted inequalities of the Incidence of Local Taxation, this House is of opinion that the
financial injustice complained of can only be removed by a comprehensive measure, nnd
that an equitable re-adjustment of Taxation,- as between real and personal property·., is
urgently required,"-(.Sir Riehunl Pnuet,-instead thereof:-
Question put, "That the words proposed to lie left out stand part «if the· Question:'*-
