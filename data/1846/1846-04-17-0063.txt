Protection of Life (Ireland) BiU,--Order read, for resuming.adjourned Debate on Amendment proposed
to be made to the Question [30th Match], »'That the BiU be now read the first time,"
and which Amendment was to leave.out from the word " That" to the end of the* Question, in
order to add the words "while'thus House deplores the existence of outrage in Ireland, and is
sincerely anxious for its repression, it is of opinion that such outrage will be aggravated, -not
removed, by the arbitrary, unjust, and unconstitutional enactments of this Bill ; and. that
it is the duty of Parliament to adopt such measures as will tend to eradicate the causes
which produce these crimes, instead of resorting ltr4aws which will harass and oppress' the
innocent without restraining the guilty ; and which being restrictive of public liberty, cannot fail
to augment national discontent,"-(Mr. O'Connell,)-instead thereof :-Question again proposed,
" That the words proposed to be left out stand part of the Question :"'-Debate resumed:-*·
Motion made, and Question put, "That the Debate be now adjourned:"-Tlie House divided)
