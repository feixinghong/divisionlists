the gallantry of the Turkish Soldiery, and of the devotion of the British Officers, at the Siege of
Kars, it feels it to be equally a duty to. express its conviction that the capitulation of that fortress,
and thé surrender of the army which defended it, thereby endangering the safety of the Asiatic
Provinces of Turkey, were in a great measure owing to the.want of foresight. and energy on the
part of Her Majesty's Administration :"-(Mr. Whiteside :)-And which Amendment was, to leave
