FaU of Kars,-Order read, for resuming adjourned Debate, on Question [28th April], " That, while this
House feels it to be its duty to express its admiration of the gallantry of the Turkish Soldiery, and
of the devotion of the British Officers, at the Siege of Kàrs, it feels it to be equally a duty to express
its conviction that the capitulation of that fortress, and the Surrender of the army which defended
it, thereby endangering the safety of the Asiatic Provinces of Turkey, were in a great measure
owing to the want of foresight and energy on the part of Her Majesty's Administration '"'-(Mr.
Whiteside ;J-iDebate resumed.-Amendment proposed, to leave out from the word " Kars " to the
end of the Question, in order to add the words " it is of opinion that it is not expedient to offer
any judgment on the causes and consequences of the capitulation of that fortress until the House
has had an opportunity of considering the terms of the Treaty of Peace, and the Protocols of the
Conferences recently held at Paris, now laid upon the Table,"-fMr. Ker Seymer,)-instead thereof:
-Question proposed, " That the words proposed to be left out stand part of the Question :"-
Debate arising; Motion made, and Question put, "That the Debate be now adjourned:" -
